 * @brief iovation FraudForce SDK for iOS
 *
 * iovation identifies devices through information collected by this SDK,
 * which runs on an end userâ€™s iOS device. FraudForce schedules and runs
 * tasks in an asynchronous queue that collect the data necessary to generate
 * a blackbox containing details about the device. This blackbox must then be
 * transmitted to your servers to be used in a reputation check (for example a
 * @p CheckTransactionDetails call).
 *
 * @version 5.2.0
 * @copyright 2010-2021 iovation, Inc. All rights reserved.
 *
 * iovation hereby grants to Client a nonexclusive, limited, non-transferable,
 * revocable and non-sublicensable license to install, use, copy and
 * distribute the FraudForce SDK solely as necessary to use the the iovation
 * Global Device Intelligence Platform from within software created and
 * distributed by Client, pursuant to the
 * <a href="https://help.iovation.com/Downloads/iovation_SDK_License">License</a>
 * and Service Agreement between iovation and Client.
